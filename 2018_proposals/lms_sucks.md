## Abstract:	
We devote so much attention and resources to the user experience and design of front-facing sites that bring students into our schools, but once we've got them enrolled, we drop them off in LMS hell--a third party tool designed more for the administrivia of the learning instead of the learner's experience. In this session, we'll talk about why the LMS fails at providing learners with a good user-experience, what the ideal learning experience should be, and what you can do for now. If you care about the learner's entire journey from prospective to current to graduate, if you have had the misfortune of taking a course in an LMS and still rant about it, or if your work is in educational technology, this talk is for you.

## Pitch:	
Whether they are in educational technology or not, people in our HighEdWeb committee have strong opinions about the LMS. We're web people, we care about user experience, and it kills us to have to work in an LMS, let alone know that our students are forced to work in them. Whether the LMS is Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas, Sakai, or something else, they all seem to miss the mark for providing students with a rich, engaging, user-friendly experience. We spend so much time and resources trying to differentiate ourselves from other institutions, but when it comes to learning management, we continue to just delegate that experience to the same vendors every other institution is using. It's time for us to think about the product we're selling, learning experience, and not just how to sell it.
