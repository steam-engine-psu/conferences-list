## Abstract:	
What do small web projects and puppies have in common? While both are small and cute, neither should be adopted without planning for their care and feeding. This session will cover a process for how to tackle the planning of smaller departmental websites from user and author experience, content, design, and governance. Learn how to get runaway projects back on a leash!

## Pitch:	
Small departments, working groups, and faculty want pet websites like my kids want a puppy. They jump right to want it to look without taking into consideration their needs, what they will feed it, and who will be providing care. After being on a some small "pet" projects, I've learned how to facilitate discussions that guide stakeholders into a usable, sustainable site. I'll share some of the steps I took and what materials I used to plan for these small projects striking a balance between keeping the effort reasonable and sufficiently planning.
