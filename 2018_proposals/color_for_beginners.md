## Session Description:	
Are you a unicorn, charged with designing and making? Are your design skills self-taught? Would you like to learn more about how to use color effectively in your work? Are you interested in adult coloring books with a purpose? In this session, we will be using adult coloring as a method for teaching you the basics of how to use color for accessibility, pedagody, and user experience. You'll have a hands-on opportunity to apply what we demonstrate with your very own web design coloring pages. 


_(Notes: Not sure what to write here but my idea was a session that is a few basic rules of thumb for color directed at people who are not trained as cisual designers. This presentation would also perhaps have interactive and/or printable workbook of adult coloring pages to make it more hands-on. Also because it's never been done before. Also because it might make a fun book or article proposal.


In this session...

- Color for the Web: RGBA, HSL, Hex
