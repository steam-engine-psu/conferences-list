## Session Description:	have also pitched that same [session for HighEdWeb 2018](free_as_in_puppies_session.md).)

What do small web projects and puppies have in common? While both are small and cute, neither should be adopted without planning for their care and feeding. 

Small departments, working groups, and faculty want pet websites like my kids want a puppy. They jump right to want it to look without taking into consideration their needs, what they will feed it, and who will be providing care. After being on a some small "pet" projects, we've learned how to plan these sites from user and author experience, content, design, and governance. 

This year, we'll walk you through our this process in a workshop format where you can apply our steps in hands-on activities. Learn how to get runaway projects back on a leash!
