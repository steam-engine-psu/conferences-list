## Session Description:

Attendees will learn:
- how color affects accessibility,
- how keyboard navigation affects accessibility, 
- how to describe maps for users who can't see them, 
- how layers can improve accessibility, and 
- what assistive technology is popular with users.

### Aaron Knight, SUNY-ESF
Aaron Knight is responsible for internal web portals, course registration, grading and institutional reporting for the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry's Information Systems group. Basically, if you wouldn’t notice him until it’s suddenly not working and is required for the college to function, he’s probably responsible for it. He spends a lot of time figuring out the quirks of mapping systems and other peculiarities of the Googleverse so you don’t have to.
