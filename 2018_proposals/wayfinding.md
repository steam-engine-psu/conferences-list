How do you make content that is inherently visual accessible? There are a multitude of ways you can help your wayfinding and other visual content be more accessible for all of your visitors. After all - they need to be able to find you too.

Attendees will learn:

- how keyboard navigation affects accessibility, 
- how to describe maps for users who can't see them, 
- how layers can improve accessibility, and 
- what assistive technology is popular with users.
