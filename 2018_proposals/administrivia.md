## Session Description:	
_TODO/Work in Progress_ 

We spend so much time, money, and full time employees on making sure our web presence successfully woos our audiences. We know that user experience is important, and we design the interface to be simple,, yet attractive. But when we finally win them over and we're ready to seal the deal, what does that call to action lead to? Is it a form in a third party system that looks like it's from the 1990s? Is it a time consuming and frustrating experience just when our visitors were about to commit to us? Educational web professionals, your administrivia is showing!

_(This would include all admistrivia, crappy 3rd-party integrations, legacy in-house tools, etc. to be more broadly applicable.)_

In this session...
- You'll understand that administriva is part of the user journey.
- How we woo our visitors with good front-facing experience and then lure them into aging, cumbersome systems.
- Ways to vet systems that our visitors have to touch.
- Tips and tools for working around administriva.

Notes:
- Designing for students not admins.
- You are the expert. Many stakeholders, but product is for users/students/donors.
- Systems part of the user journey.
- Postmilennial not lazy; they just have higher expectations. Learning style has changed. Anything that's cumbersome.
- Recognize blind spots. Win 3.11 still feels new, but after post-mils.
- Use framework, but don't tell admins. Don't say framework or front-end.
- APIs, theming, headless. Community support.
- Collecting data.
- Administriva is part of suer journey.
- User experience and actual users to evaluate.
- Not build v. buy. It's continuum.
- Walled garden --> no room for innovation.
- Language & microcopy. Vendor-forced? Developer? Editors?
- Examples: actual tools, cardsorting screenshots, etc.
