## Abstract:	
Do you have trouble with your content contributors? Is your content out-of-date, inaccurate, or inaccessible? Are you tired of getting support calls to just "put this on the web for me"? Since these contributors aren't likely your direct reports, and contributing content may not even be their main duty, you have very few tools in your arsenal to coax them. You have no sticks. You might not even have carrots. But you can have an AX. AX, or authoring experience, is the user-experience for people who author or contribute content. In this session you will learn about AX, the benefits of a good AX, and what you can do to improve your CMS's AX.

## Pitch:	
What I have learned as technology trainer, a developer, and as an accessible interface designer is that AX is every bit as important as UX, since users will ultimately consume the content created by authors. A difficult AX leads to longer author trainings, that your authors won't likely remember. And if they don't remember their training, they are more likely to make mistakes. Or to call you for help. Or to avoid maintaining content altogether. I want to share what I have learned from designing and developing user experience for content authors: how to use content modeling to help build interfaces for authoring content, how interfaces can walk a contributor through the authoring process, how an interface can prevent errors, and how to tie documentation and content scheduling together so that authors know what to update, when, and how to do it.
