This workshop is focused on addressing current issues and best practices experienced in building out conceptual models and collecting examples of real-life use cases. Attendees include IT architects, educational technologists, faculty, and software engineers from many universities. UAPI is an unConference. It has no assigned speakers or panels, so it's about getting stuff done. We will have a trained open space facilitator at the workshop to run the show and make sure we are properly organized." |
